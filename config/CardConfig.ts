      "This is where my humble beginings resides in gaming in general. In 8th Standard I used to have frequent LAN parties w friends that eventually led us to buy the game the following year. I genuinely beleive that its the best shooter/fps ever made, but the recent transition to cs2 is not it man. Firsty it just runs worse and then the playerbase is pretty much dead because some missing iconic features. I'm sad about this and wish the golden days return fr",

      "Hmmm lets see, where to begin? Well, my friends and I were really looking forward to its official launch, after watching multiple streamers play it during the beta, and yes I gotta admit that its pretty fun! HOWEVER i think its still inferior to CS mechanically but this requries patience and skills in a different way altogether. People can debate all day about CS v Valo but one things for certain: Valo is not boring at all, infact more engaging than CS. My experience with the game has always been fun since i play ONLY with friends and not soloQ, which is good for sanity as well hahah",

      "I gotta thank epic games for this, back in 2020 it went F2P and there was a huge influx of new players all of a sudden. Me and friends started grinding this just before college and even though they left after a while, i kept going on (my main still to this day haha). Huge fan of RLCS btw! In terms of the game well its one of the hardest games to master at all and people have 10K hours of experience usually get to the top rank. You gotta grind for a long ass time to even start seeing some progress",

      "WOW this game needs no introduction. Who knew a funny little block-looking game would take the world by storm. Nevertheless, I got my beginnings in the game when my cousin showed me this back when I was very young (maybe around 5th standard I think). I think I rememeber the version being 1.2.5 or 1.2.6 but whatever it was, it was vastly different than what it is today. Anyways, I still continue to play this game sometimes, just for that sweet nostalgia in chunks of 2 weeks a.k.a the infamous TWO-WEEK-PHASE; im not immune to that unfortunately.",

      "See, I've never owned a particularly powerful PC like ever, but when I do at some point in the future, Apex will be one of the games that i will MOST DEFINITELY going to grind. To me, its the best battle royale game ever. The movement, abilties, overall atmosphere feels really nice. The only thing thats a little bad about this game is its skill ceiling. You NEED to put in the hours in order to even stand a chance. Its different than normal 5v5 shooters, since this is a battle royale, you can measure your loss (1/20 chance to lose if you think about it). Assuming not playing stealthily, you will be one of the firsts to lose, gradually your placements will improve as you will understand the basics of playing, engagement, positioning and overall aim; this isnt one-kill headshot bro, you will need to ACTIVELY keep shooting at the target in a gunfight, and combine that with the overall faster pace of movement (compared to the competition), its genuinely one of the most satisfying experiences you can feel in gaming.",

      "Nothing much to comment on here. See, I won't be lying to you if I said that NFS as a franchise has been on a constant decline since forever but to a lot of people, Heat is a refresher. The overall experience, and the day/night system is done in a fun way here. As you progress, cars go fast and THEY GO FAST ALRIGHT, sounds are awesome, and soundtrack is particularly decent. Cops get brutal on the higher heat levels, great customization of cars. Overall a solid experience coming from someone who has played em all- Carbon, Underground 1/2, Most wanted 2005/2012, ProStreet etc",

      "Again, as the numbers say, no need for introductions. This game is popular as fuck and for a good reason; the environment, gameplay, graphics still holds up today. The story is well written, dialogues are good, and feel very engaging. The online counterpart, GTA Online is equally as good, perfect to goof around with friends and do heists which are so well thought out that it really feels like a movie. I was able to grab the game for free (thanks Epic) but even if its in the neighbourhood of 500-1K Rs, I would consider it a full 'paisa-wasool' or hindi for 'bang for the buck'.",
